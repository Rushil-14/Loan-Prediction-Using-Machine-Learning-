# Loan-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-

## Objective
This project aims to  develop a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on historical data. The objective of a Loan Prediction project using Machine Learning is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine the likelihood of a loan applicant's loan approval.

## Project Overview
### Project Focus:
Build a predictive model that automates the loan approval process by analyzing historical data using machine learning algorithms.
### Data Processing:
Preprocess and clean the dataset, perform feature engineering, and apply various ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
### Model Performance:
Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and select the best model for predicting loan approval.
### Outcome: 
Provide a reliable and efficient loan prediction system that aids financial institutions in making data-driven decisions.
